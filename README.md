## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Google account login and Web Station deployment

The browser uses native Strapi REST with a shared strapi_jwt local-storage bearer token. Google returns to this app's own `/games/blackjack/auth/google` callback. The reusable account client and form are served from `https://api.jaimegonzalezjr.com/auth/client.v1.js` and maintained in the Strapi repository. Native game collections enforce account ownership on the server. Existing anonymous names require administrator migration. API_BASE_URL defaults to https://api.jaimegonzalezjr.com.


The legacy Nuxt 2 build pins matching Vue 2.6.14 renderer/compiler versions and enables the OpenSSL compatibility provider for its Webpack 4 build on Node 22. Framework modernization remains separate work.

Account controls mount inside this app's own layout. Strapi Content Manager → OAuth Applications configures callback/return URLs, Google/password options, registration, and shared/separate sessions. Current configuration is Google with shared login. No provider secrets belong in frontend environment files.

## Local configuration and publishing

Normal builds use `/` as their base path. Set `APP_BASE_PATH` in the build environment to host under a subdirectory; unset or empty leaves the default. Set `API_BASE_URL` for the compatible shared-account backend. Environment values are embedded during the build. Private `.env` overrides are ignored by Git; only `.env.example` is tracked.

Build the application using its normal npm build/generate command, then publish the completed static output with your own hosting tools. Personal paths and settings belong in the ignored repo-local `.env`, outside version control. Configure the backend OAuth application registry with this deployment's own callback and return URLs. Browser route guards do not replace backend ownership checks.

### Output directory override

The ignored repo-local `.env` can set `BUILD_OUTPUT` to a directory. Unset or empty keeps the framework's normal output folder. The framework cleans that output during generation/build, so obsolete files do not accumulate.

A local installation can point `BUILD_OUTPUT` directly at its hosted app directory and use the normal npm build/generate command without a deployment script. A failed build can leave that directory incomplete until the next successful build. Keep persistent data outside the build output. Personal paths and environment overrides remain untracked.
